            <h2>My mission is to collaborate on future environments that promote accessibility, inclusivity, & equality.</h2>
            <p>I have a passion for understanding human behavior and value empathy, curiosity, and humility. On good days and bad I strive to be 100% authentic and honest with myself and others.<br><br>Working in many different fields, I’ve formed relationships that have enabled me to understand human interaction on a deeper, more intimate level. Feeling the struggle or joy of another opens the door to compassion and understanding. Without this critical part of design, you have fool’s gold.<br><br>To articulate my approach, I give equal focus on human centered design and engaging visual components. Collaborating with an open, honest, and positive mindset helps me quickly adapt when a project inevitably takes new or unexpected turns. I love being involved in the entire process, starting with ideation and definition, to prototyping, testing, and delivering the final iteration.</p>
